Change selectedLocation to selectedUnitLocation
Change all references to Action to BoardAction
Handle the promotion in a separate Http call after action
Move derived state to selectors or components (movableLoations, attackableLocations, etc)
Move the promote into a new action reducer (start promote, end promote?)
Is there any better way to do the squares?
Is there a better way to handle getGame? what if a new push happens in the middle of a turn? (i think we should just update the game state like units and allowed actions, if selected is the same unit then keep it)
Remove unused imports
