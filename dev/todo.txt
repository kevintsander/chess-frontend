------
Overhaul chess-engine players system
 - can we remove unit dependency on player, just color only?
 - allow users to be changed
 - or, what if we keep it? initial user set, and if changed then who cares? game_log would be wrong but this is a weird chess scenario anyway, you're kinda "taking over" for the original person anyway
      - but then we still need players to be set AFTER initializing the game, if not in chess engine then in the API and front end at least


      ideally, we'll show a chess board with no units on it, until game is "started" (either by button or by both players logging in)
